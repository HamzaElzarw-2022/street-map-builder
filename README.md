# Street Map Builder

Street Map Builder is an interactive tool for creating, editing, and visualizing custom street maps using a graph-based 
structure. This application allows users to design maps by defining intersections (nodes) and connections (edges) 
with attributes like direction and speed limits. It is built with React to ensure scalability, reusability, 
and a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Interactive Graph Editor**:
    - Add and position nodes (intersections or endpoints).
    - Create edges (connections) with properties like direction and speed limit.
    - Edit or delete nodes and edges easily.

- **Canvas Visualization**:
    - Real-time display of the map structure.
    - Visual feedback for selected nodes and edges.

- **Editing Panel**:
    - A side ribbon for editing node and edge attributes.
    - Validation to prevent invalid connections or duplicate entries.

- **Save and Load Maps**:
    - Save created maps to a database or file.
    - Load and edit existing maps.

- **Map Export/Import**:
    - Export maps as JSON for use in other projects.
    - Import maps for further editing or visualization.

This project is meant for Integration with another project to be developed later.
